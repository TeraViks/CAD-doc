# Kata 4: Aluminum Tubing CAD

Create a single CAD model that can be configured to be 1"x1" or 1"x2". When configured at 1"x1", all four faces of the tubing should include holes centered on the face at 0.500" pitch.  When configured as 1"x2" the 1" faces should include holes centered as in the 1"x1" case. The 2" sides should contain 3 rows of holes on a 0.500" pitch. Each row should be located 0.500" from its nearest edge/row. All holes should be sized for #10 bolt clearance (0.201"), but should be configurable so that they can all be changed to a different diameter with a single operation. Set up your model so that the the tube thickness is 0.125", but can be easily changed to another thickness. Make the length 48", but make it easily configurable.
