# Kata 1: L-Bracket Gusset CAD

Create a CAD model of an L-Bracket. Each leg of the L should be 1" wide, and 2.75" long. Include a hole pattern on each leg on 1/2" pitch. Holes should be .201" DIA. Set up your model so that the length of the legs can be indiviually changed easily. When the length of a leg changes, the 1/2" pitch hole pattern should automatically update to reflect the new length. Include fillets on all convex and concave corners. The fillet radius should be 1/16". Set up your model so that the fillet radius on all corners can be easily changed to 1/8". Make the thickness of the bracket .125, but make it easily configurable.
